To add a new badge to BadgeSetScript use this function:
createBadge("StaffAdmin", "http://b3.ifrm.com/5920/164/0/f7000477/sunrise_clan_banners_administrator_mini.jpg", "Administrator", false);

createBadge(
"StaffAdmin", - The identifying name for the badge that we'll use later to set it to people's badge sets
"http://b3.ifrm.com/5920/164/0/f7000477/sunrise_clan_banners_administrator_mini.jpg", - The image file's url
"Administrator", - The hover text for the image on the pages
false -  - I have no idea what this does but it says false on all of them so keep it in there
);
